    <releaseNotes>qbs 1.8.1

Important bug fixes:
    * Qbs-specific build errors are now correctly linked
      in Qt Creator's issues pane (QBS-1151).
    * Fixed automatic base profile assignment for
      MSVC Qt installations (QBS-1141)
    * Various QNX fixes (QBS-1136, QBS-1137, QBS-1138, QBS-1139, QBS-1143).

Behavior changes:
    * Users now get early error messages if they forget
      the "modules", "products" or "projects" prefix
      in command line property overrides such as
      "modules.cpp.enableExceptions:false".

qbs 1.8.0

Features:
    * General:
        * It is no longer strictly required to provide a profile.
        * Sub-second timestamp resolutions are now supported on Unix
          systems.
        * Added a convenient replacement for
          product.moduleProperty("module", "property"), namely
          product.module.property.
        * The loadFile and loadExtension functions are deprecated in
          favor of the new require function, which accepts arguments of either
          form accepted by the deprecated functions.
        * Added new tool qbs-create-project to set up a new qbs
          project from an existing source tree.
        * FileTagger items can now have conditions.
        * Probe items can now appear directly under a Project item.
    * Cpp module:
        * Added support for QNX and the QCC toolchain
        * Added the cpp.useRPathLink property to control whether
          to use the -rpath-link linker option.
        * Provided the means to easily combine source files for the C
          language family in order to support "amalgamation builds".
        * Introduced cpp.treatSystemHeadersAsDependencies.
    * Qt modules:
        * Introduced property Qt.core.combineMocOutput.
        * Introduced Qt.core.enableKeywords for simple disabling of
          the "signals", "slots" and "emit" symbols.
Important bug fixes:
    * Improved scalability of parallel builds on Linux by starting
      Process commands via a dedicated launcher process.
Behavior changes:
    * The base directory for source files changed from the product
      source directory to the parent directory of the file where the files are
      listed.

qbs 1.7.2

Important bug fixes:
    * macOS: Fixed App Extension builds on older versions of Xcode/macOS
    * Windows: Fixed handling of files on network shares
    * Fixed syntax error in Qt module that occurred with static Qt builds
    * Several fixes for the Visual Studio generator (QBS-1077, QBS-1100)

qbs 1.7.1

Important bug fixes:
    * Fixed race condition in qmake build (QBS-1091)
    * Qt Creator no longer leaves empty build directories
      behind after cancelled project loading (QTCREATORBUG-17543)
    * Fixed an exception crossing the API boundary

qbs 1.7.0

Features:
    * Added a generator for Visual Studio projects.
    * The Group item is now nestable.
    * Stricter type checking for properties.
    * Added support for generating qrc files.
    * Added full support for the QtScxml module.
    * Introduced cpp.soVersion.
    * Added support for building Inno Setup packages.
    * Tentative support for Visual Studio 2017.
    * We now assume UTF-8 encoding for project files.
    * In Scanner items, input.fileName now contains
      a filename rather than the full path.
    * Warnings encountered during project resolving are now stored
      and re-displayed when the project is loaded.
    * Documentation was improved in several places, most
      notably for the Rule item.
    * Support for the deprecated Transformer item was removed.
Important bug fixes:
    * Long paths on Windows are handled (QBS-1068).
    * Cyclic module dependencies are detected (QBS-1044).
    * The libqbscore soname now includes the minor version,
      so that it will not stay the same across ABI changes
      (QBS-1002).

qbs 1.6.1

Features:
    * Added cpp.linkerWrapper property.
Important bug fixes:
    * Fixed a number of bugs evaluating module properties (QBS-845, QBS-1005).
    * Fixed x86_64 > x86 cross compiling (QBS-1028).
    * Fixed dynamic rules with generated inputs (QBS-1029).

qbs 1.6.0

* Added lex_yacc module.
* Introduced property cpp.systemRunPaths.
* Introduced the ability to check a module's version in a Depends item.
* Introduced cpp.driverFlags, which allows specifying flags to be
  passed to the compiler driver (in any mode), but never the system linker.
* Introduced cpp.linkerMode property to allow selection of the
  correct linker (C driver, C++ driver, or system linker) based on the
  objects being linked.
* Added automatic escaping of arguments passed to the
  cpp.linkerFlags and cpp.platformLinkerFlags properties using the -Wl
  or -Xlinker syntaxes. To revert to the old behavior,
  Project.minimumQbsVersion can be set to a version lower than 1.6.
* Each build configuration now requires a unique name, which
  is specified on the command line in the same place that qbs.buildVariant
  used to be specified. This allows building for multiple configurations
  with the same variant.</releaseNotes>
