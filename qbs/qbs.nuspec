    <releaseNotes>qbs 1.7.1

Important bug fixes:
    * Fixed race condition in qmake build (QBS-1091)
    * Qt Creator no longer leaves empty build directories
      behind after cancelled project loading (QTCREATORBUG-17543)
    * Fixed an exception crossing the API boundary
    
qbs 1.7.0

Features:
    * Added a generator for Visual Studio projects.
    * The Group item is now nestable.
    * Stricter type checking for properties.
    * Added support for generating qrc files.
    * Added full support for the QtScxml module.
    * Introduced cpp.soVersion.
    * Added support for building Inno Setup packages.
    * Tentative support for Visual Studio 2017.
    * We now assume UTF-8 encoding for project files.
    * In Scanner items, input.fileName now contains
      a filename rather than the full path.
    * Warnings encountered during project resolving are now stored
      and re-displayed when the project is loaded.
    * Documentation was improved in several places, most
      notably for the Rule item.
    * Support for the deprecated Transformer item was removed.
Important bug fixes:
    * Long paths on Windows are handled (QBS-1068).
    * Cyclic module dependencies are detected (QBS-1044).
    * The libqbscore soname now includes the minor version,
      so that it will not stay the same across ABI changes
      (QBS-1002).

qbs 1.6.1

Features:
    * Added cpp.linkerWrapper property.
Important bug fixes:
    * Fixed a number of bugs evaluating module properties (QBS-845, QBS-1005).
    * Fixed x86_64 > x86 cross compiling (QBS-1028).
    * Fixed dynamic rules with generated inputs (QBS-1029).

qbs 1.6.0

* Added lex_yacc module.
* Introduced property cpp.systemRunPaths.
* Introduced the ability to check a module's version in a Depends item.
* Introduced cpp.driverFlags, which allows specifying flags to be
  passed to the compiler driver (in any mode), but never the system linker.
* Introduced cpp.linkerMode property to allow selection of the
  correct linker (C driver, C++ driver, or system linker) based on the
  objects being linked.
* Added automatic escaping of arguments passed to the
  cpp.linkerFlags and cpp.platformLinkerFlags properties using the -Wl
  or -Xlinker syntaxes. To revert to the old behavior,
  Project.minimumQbsVersion can be set to a version lower than 1.6.
* Each build configuration now requires a unique name, which
  is specified on the command line in the same place that qbs.buildVariant
  used to be specified. This allows building for multiple configurations
  with the same variant.</releaseNotes>
